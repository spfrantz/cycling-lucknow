        <p>Lucknow has limited services for quality bicycles and cycling accessories. If you're visiting for a short time and want to hire a bicycle, consider posting on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/CYCLOPBUYSELL">Cyclop Facebook group</a>. A kind soul may be willing to loan or rent you a cycle. Otherwise I am not aware of any shops that offer rentals.</p>

        <p>There are a great number of small cycle repair shops that can offer basic repairs such as fixing flats and welding steel. Given that the vast majority of bicycles on the road in India are single-speed and do not use standard international components, mechanics experienced with modern road or mountain bikes are few and far between. They may have remarkable ingenuity in helping you get back on the road but you will likely want to come prepared to perform most of your own routine maintenance and repairs.</p>

        <h3>Bicycles on Trains</h3>
        <p>The procedure for bringing a bicycle on the train at Charbagh station appears to be something like the following. Allow at least 90 minutes:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Obtain and fill out a baggage form at the cloak room on Platform 1;</li>
          <li>Behind the freight / baggage area of the station (not far from the cloak room), there are men who prepare motorbikes and other baggage for shipment. They will provide you with a metal sign to hang on the bicycle and a marker to write your full name and the bicycle's destination. The staff at the cloak room also require that the bicycle be "packed" to avoid damage. This appears to be entirely a formality that involves wrapping the seat in plastic or burlap. The men behind the baggage area will also do that. Total cost is Rs 100;</li>
          <li>Bring the form, bicycle, and a photocopy of your passport or other ID to the cloak room. The bicycle should be put on the train and unloaded at your destination, but do inquire as to whether you should bring it to the platform yourself and supervise the loading and unloading.</li>
